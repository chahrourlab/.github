# Chahrour Lab
Interrogating the genome to better understand the mechanisms causing autism spectrum disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders and inform innovative therapies.
## Research and Mission
Our overall interest is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders. We focus on identifying disease genes, understanding how they lead to neuronal dysfunction, and mapping the impacted pathways to inform the development of targeted therapies.
### Gene discovery in autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
We apply whole exome and genome sequencing and other approaches like forward genetics to identify pathogenic variants that underlie ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.
### Mechanisms of rare neurodevelopmental disorders
We leverage animal models to dissect the pathways in which genes normally function, and characterize the molecular mechanisms leading to the phenotypes exhibited in these conditions.
### Informing discovery of innovative therapies
Our work informs the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for people living with neurodevelopmental disorders.
## Join Our Studies
Our lab studies the genetics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We hope that by finding the genes responsible for ASD, we can better understand the processes that are disrupted in ASD as well as how these genes function in normal brain development.

Adults and children with ASD, and their family members, are invited to participate in our research. We are able to enroll interested individuals and families from around the world.
